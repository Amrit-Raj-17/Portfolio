      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm <strong>Amrit Raj Thakur</strong>, a final-year B.Tech CSE student at <strong>IEM, Kolkata</strong>, with a strong passion for building full-stack web applications.
        I specialize in <strong>Java (Spring Boot)</strong> for backend development and <strong>React.js</strong> for dynamic frontend interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience includes working on <em>LicenseGuard</em>, a license management platform developed during my internship at <strong>Sasken Technologies</strong>, focusing on real-world software tracking and asset management.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy solving meaningful problems, writing clean code, and constantly exploring new tools, technologies, and best practices in software development.
